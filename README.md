This repository contains the isopach shapefiles used for the paper titled The Millennium Eruption of Changbaishan Tianchi Volcano is VEI 6, not 7.

The isopachs were provided as supplementary material together with the paper, but the files are broken (possibly due to post-processing) and we cannot modify them. 
The isopachs are hence put here again. 

There are four sets of isopachs in this repository. 


HornSchmincke00: 	digitized from Horn and Schmincke (2000)	          	B-Tm ash isopachs


Liu98: 			digitized from Liu (1998)				        Proximal ash isopachs


tephra_atlas:		digitized from Machida (2003)			                B-Tm ash isopachs


added_iso contains two isopachs			


	inferred_1mm_iso		      constructed in Yang et al, 2021                             inferred 1 mm isopach of the B-Tm ash

 
	isopach:		              constructed in Yang et al, 2021                             isopachs completed in Yang et al, 2021, based on original isopachs of Machida (2003)
