Please refer to the paper given above for more details on the origins of the isopachs

The isopachs were provided as supplementary material together with the paper, but the files are broken (possibly due to post-processing) and we cannot modify them. 
The isopachs are hence put here again. 

There are four sets of isopachs in this repository. 


1. HornSchmincke00: 					digitized from Horn and Schmincke (2000),	          	B-Tm ash isopachs


2. Liu98: 						digitized from Liu (1998),				        Proximal ash isopachs


3. tephra_atlas:					digitized from Machida (2003),			                B-Tm ash isopachs


4. added_iso contains two isopachs,			



	a. inferred_1mm_iso:		      		constructed in Yang et al, 2021,                             	inferred 1 mm isopach of the B-Tm ash
	b. isopach:		              		constructed in Yang et al, 2021,                             	isopachs completed in Yang et al, 2021, based on original isopachs of Machida (2003)
